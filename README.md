# Tube Planner

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Introduction

This app will offer the user a means of creating an infinite number of
Tube journeys by clicking on individual stations in turn.


## User journeys


### Create a route

1. Select stations by clicking one at a time. A station can be added any
number of times but clicking the same station twice in succession will
deselect it.
2. Click to save the current route. Route default name can be auto
generated to include a timestamp
3. Route is saved.


### View (read) saved routes


### Edit (update) a saved route


### Delete a saved route
